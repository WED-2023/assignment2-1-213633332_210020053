Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet dusted with cornmeal. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Arrange the fresh mozzarella slices evenly over the sauce. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately top with fresh basil leaves.
